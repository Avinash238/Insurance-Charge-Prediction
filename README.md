# Insurance-Charge-Prediction
This GitHub repository contains a data analysis and machine learning project aimed at identifying patterns in insurance charges across various categories and accurately predicting insurance charges. Here's an overview of the project:

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to conduct an in-depth data analysis to identify patterns in insurance charges and develop a machine learning model to predict insurance charges accurately.

Data Analysis
Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the distribution of insurance charges and understand the relationships between different features. The EDA process involved visualizations, summary statistics, and data exploration to uncover key trends and patterns in the dataset.

Data Preprocessing
To ensure that the data was suitable for machine learning, data preprocessing techniques were applied, including Label Encoding for categorical features and Standard Scaling for numerical features. This step helped in preparing the data for modeling.

Machine Learning Model
For the insurance charge prediction, a Random Forest regression model was employed. Random Forest is a robust ensemble learning technique known for its ability to handle complex relationships in data and make accurate predictions. The model was trained on the preprocessed data to learn the patterns in insurance charges.

Model Evaluation
The performance of the Random Forest regression model was evaluated using the R-squared (R2) metric. An impressive R2 score of 0.84 was achieved, signifying the model's strong predictive capabilities. An R2 score of 1 indicates a perfect prediction, and a score of 0.84 demonstrates that the model can explain a significant portion of the variance in insurance charges.
